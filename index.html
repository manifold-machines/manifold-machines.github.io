                 <h2>III. Our Philosophy</h2>
                 <p>Large language models are trained and used at an unprecedented scale. As a result, the resource strain for open-source builders and users ‚Äî be it GPU hours or trillions of tokens ‚Äî is monumental. We believe much can be achieved with small, local models, by incorporating the latest research advances and doing the boring parts well.</p>
                 
                 <p>This means:
                 <ul>
                     <li>experimenting with novel architectures and techniques</li>
                     <li>being meticulous about high-quality data</li>
                     <li>optimizing for efficiency without sacrificing capability</li>
                 </ul>
                 </p>
                 
                 <p>Safety is paramount in our work. As AI capabilities move into a more agential territory, we find it critical to understanda and prevent misaligned behavior. For us, this means familiarity with the most recent safety research, transparency of our development practices and rigorous testing.</p>

His research experience spans activation engineering (using a novel method to elicit/inhibit complex behaviors in LLMs), real-world safety of AI agents, and reinforcement learning. During his physics education, he has worked on engineering optical instruments for the European Space Agency's ATHENA space telescope at the Netherlands Insititute for Space Research, as well as researching molecular dynamics associated with a genetic disease using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy at the Zernike Institute for Advanced Materials. Ilija finds it crucial to train models that can exhibit compositional generalization, where models can reliably compose complex functions from simpler ones.</p>

She has a background in traditional software engineering and user interface design, and her current interests lie in the sociotechnical aspects of AI, including human-computer interaction, accountability, and interpretability. Her work has centered on multilingual and cross-cultural web platforms, with an emphasis on public impact tech projects, as well as developing frameworks to evaluate the accessibility of VR and AI-powered tools. Through coursework and research, she is particularly interested in how we can design AI systems that are both technically robust and socially responsible.</p>

She has a Bachelor's degree in Computing Science from the University of Groningen. Her work focuses on machine learning, data-centric AI, with a focus on building models that are interpretable and reliable. For her  Bachelor‚Äôs thesis, she explored learning in the model space, comparing sampling algorithms to explore how machine learning can operate over structured models rather than raw data. More recently, she has been analyzing scientific progress through citation networks, tracing how knowledge evolves across research papers over time. She is especially interested in how models learn, how data influences that process and how we can make AI systems more transparent.</p>
